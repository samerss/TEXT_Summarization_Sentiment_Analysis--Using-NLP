    "Our program is designed to help you analyze and summarize text data quickly and easily. Whether you are reading a news article, blog post, or any other type of text data, our program can help you determine the sentiment of the text and summarize its content based on your chosen percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "Our program uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze the sentiment of the input text. You don't need to worry about negativity, our program can determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. This can be especially useful for businesses or individuals who want to quickly analyze customer feedback or social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization:\n",
    "Our program can also summarize the input text to a percentage that you choose. This means that you don't need to read the entire text to get the gist of its content. Simply input the text and choose the percentage of the summary you want, and our program will do the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our program is a powerful tool that can save you time and help you make informed decisions based on the sentiment and content of your text data. Give it a try today and see how it can help you!"
